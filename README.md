# Analysis of mutational signatures in cancer patients.
## Repository created by Jose Camacho Valenzuela.

### Disclaimer.
This repository provides examples of mock `Rscripts` from open-source packages. These scripts are intended to serve as generalized templates, which can be adapted or modified according to users' specific needs.

## 1) Mutational signatures with SigMA (Gulhan et al., 2019).
Script available in the subdirectory <b> 01_SigMA </b>, file `Script_SigMA.R`. In this script, analysis of Signature 3 is exemplified in 3 patients' tumors.

## 2) Mutational signatures with MutationalPatterns (Blokzijl et al., 2018).
Script available in the subdirectory <b> 02_MutationalPatterns </b>, file `Script_MutationalPatterns.R`. In this script, analysis of multi-signatures is exemplified in 3 patients' tumors, including SBS and INDEL signatures.

## 3) Mutational signatures with mutSigExtractor (Martínez-Jiménez et al., 2023).
Script available in the subdirectory <b> 03_MutSigExtractor </b>, file `Script_MutSigExtractor.R`. In this script, analysis of multi-signatures is exemplified in 3 patients' tumors, including SBS and INDEL signatures.
